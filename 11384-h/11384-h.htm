  <h2>KEW PALACE.</h2>

  </div>

  <p>Innumerable are the instances of princes having sought to perpetuate
  their memories by the building of palaces, from the <i>Domus Aurea</i>,
  or golden house of Nero, to the comparatively puny structures of our
  own times. As specimens of modern magnificence and substantial comfort,
  the latter class of edifices may be admirable; but we are bound to
  acknowledge, that in boldness and splendour of design, they cannot
  assimilate to the labours of antiquity, much of whose stupendous
  character is to this day preserved in many series of interesting
  ruins:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Whilst in the progress of the long decay,</p>
      <p>Thrones sink to dust, and nations pass away.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As a record of this degeneracy, near the western corner of Kew Green
  stands the new palace, commenced for George III., under the direction
  of the late James Wyatt, Esq. The north front, the only part open to
  public inspection, possesses an air of solemn, sullen grandeur; but it
  very ill accords with the taste and science generally displayed by its
  nominal architect.</p>

  <p>To quote the words of a contemporary, "this Anglo-Teutonic,
  castellated, gothized structure must be considered as an abortive
  production, at once illustrative of bad taste and defective judgment.
  From the small size of the windows and the diminutive proportion of
  its turrets, it would seem to possess</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"'Windows that exclude the light,</p>
      <p>And passages that lead to nothing.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Upon the unhappy seclusion of the <i>royal</i> architect, the works were
  suspended, and it now remains unfinished. Censure and abuse have,
  however, always been abundantly lavished on its architecture, whether
  it be the result of royal caprice or of professional study; but the
  taste of either party deserves to be taxed with its demerits.</p>

  <p>The northern front was intended to be appropriated to the use of
  domestics; the whole building is rendered nearly indestructible by
  fire, by means of cast-iron joists and rafters, &amp;c., certainly in this
  case an unnecessary precaution, since the whole pile is shortly to be
  pulled down. The foundation, too, is in a bog close to the Thames, and
  the principal object in its view is the dirty town of Brentford, on
  the opposite side of the river; a selection, <span class="pagenum">
  <a id="page210" name="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span> it would seem, of
  <i>family</i> taste, for George II. is known to have often said, when
  riding through Brentford, "I do like this place, it's so like
  Yarmany."</p>

  <p>A modern tourist, in "A Morning's Walk from London to Kew,"
  characterizes the new palace as "the <i>Bastile palace</i>, from its
  resemblance to that building, so obnoxious to freedom and freemen. On
  a former occasion," says he, "I have viewed its interior, and I am at
  a loss to conceive the motive for preferring an external form, which
  rendered it impracticable to construct within it more than a series of
  large closets, boudoirs, and rooms like oratories." The latter part of
  this censure is judiciously correct; but the epithet "bastile" is
  perhaps too harsh for some ears.</p>

  <p>The <i>old palace</i> at Kew formerly belonged to the Capel family, and
  by marriage became the property of Samuel Molyneux, Esq., secretary
  to George II. when prince of Wales. The late Frederic, prince of Wales,
  took a long lease of the house, which he made his frequent residence;
  and here, too, occasionally resided his favourite poet, James Thomson,
  author of "The Seasons." It is now held by his majesty on the same
  tenure. The house contains some good pictures, among which is a set of
  Canaletti's works; the celebrated picture of the Florence gallery, by
  Zoffany, (who resided in the neighbourhood,) was removed several years
  since. The pleasure-grounds, which contain 120 acres, were laid out by
  Sir William Chambers, one of the greatest masters of ornamental
  English gardening. Altogether they form a most delightful suburban
  retreat, and we hope to take an early opportunity of noticing them
  more in detail.</p>

  <p>The old mansion opposite the palace was taken on a long lease by
  Queen Caroline of the descendants of Sir Richard Lovett, and has been
  inhabited by different branches of the royal family: and here his
  present majesty was educated, under the superintendance of the late
  Dr. Markham, archbishop of York. This house was bought, in 1761, for
  the late Queen Charlotte, who died here November 17, 1818.</p>

  <p>Apart from these courtly attractions, Kew is one of the most
  interesting of the villages near London. On Kew Green once stood a
  house, the favourite retirement of Sir Peter Lely. In the church and
  cemetery, too, are interred Meyer, the celebrated miniature-painter,
  Gainsborough, and Zoffany. Their tombs are simple and unostentatious;
  but other and more splendid memorials are left to record their genius.</p>

  <p>The premature fate of Kew Palace renders
  it at this moment an object of public
  curiosity; while the annexed engraving
  may serve to identify its site, when posterity</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Asks where the fabric stood."</p>

  <h2>FINE ARTS.</h2>

  <hr />

  <h3>RAPHAEL SANZIO D'URBINO.</h3>


  <p>In No. 273 of the Mirror, <i>P.T.W.</i> has noticed the <i>Cartoons</i>
  of Raphael; and I therefore solicit the reader's attention to the
  subjoined remarks on that master's unsurpassed genius.</p>

  <p>Raphael Sanzio d'Urbino was the pupil of Pietro Perugino, but
  afterwards studied the works of Leonardo di Vinci and Michael Angelo.
  He excelled every modern painter, and was thought to equal the
  ancients; though he did not design naked figures with so much
  knowledge as Michael Angelo, who was more eminently skilled in
  anatomy; neither did he paint in so graceful a style as the Venetians;
  but he had a much more happy manner of disposing and choosing his
  subjects than any other artist who has lived since his time. His
  admirable choice of attitudes, ornaments, draperies, and expression,
  can surely never be equalled by the most successful <i>aspirant</i> in the
  fine arts. He has an undisputed title to the prince of painters; for,
  notwithstanding his premature death, he produced the most enchanting
  representations of the sublime and beautiful. A painter will ever
  derive much benefit from the study of all Raphael's pictures;
  especially from the Martyrdom of Saint Felicitas; the Transfiguration;
  Joseph explaining Pharaoh's Dream; and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211"
  name="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span> School of Athens. Among the
  wonders of art with which the School of Athens abounds, we may select
  that of four youths attending to a sage mathematician, who is
  demonstrating some theorem. One of the boys is listening with profound
  reverence to the reasoning of his master; another discovers a greater
  quickness of apprehension; while the third is endeavouring to explain
  it to the last, who stands with a gaping countenance, utterly unable
  to comprehend the learned man's discourse. Expression, which was
  Raphael's chief excellence, and in which no other master has well
  succeeded, may be seen in the above picture to perfection. Besides his
  grand historical works, he executed portraits in a good style; and was
  also an admirable architect. In person, he was handsome, and
  remarkably well made, his manners being polite and unaffected. He
  never refused to impart to others what he knew himself; by which
  conduct he became esteemed in private, as much as he was adored in
  public.</p>

  <p>This master's grand works are principally at Rome, in the Vatican; in
  the palace, Florence; Versailles; and the Palais Royal, France; the
  king's collection, Naples; and in the apartments at Hampton Court
  Palace. His best scholars were Julio Romano, Polydore, Giovanni
  d'Udine, and Gaudenzio, to all of whom he communicated the grand
  <i>arcana</i> of his wonderful art.</p>

  <h2>RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.</h2>

  <hr />

  <p>Letter from the Princess, afterwards Queen, Elizabeth, to her sister,
  Queen Mary, on her being ordered to the Tower, in consequence of a
  suspicion that she was connected with Wyat's rebellion:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"If any ever did try this old saynge, that a kinge's worde was more
    than another man's othe, I most humbly beseche your majesty to verefie
    it in me, and to remember your last promis and my last demande, that I
    be not condemned without answer and due profe: wiche it semes that now
    I am, for that without cause provid I am by your counsel frome you
    commanded to go unto the Tower; a place more wonted for a false
    traitor, than a tru subject. Wiche thogth I knowe I deserve it not,
    yet in the face of al this realme aperes that it is provid; wiche I
    pray God, I may dy the shamefullist dethe that ever any died, afore I

    God (who shal juge my trueth whatsoever malice shal devis) that I
    never practised, consiled, nor consentid to any thinge that might be
    prejudicial to your parson any way, or daungerous to the State by any
    mene. And therefor I humbly beseche your Majestie to let me answer
    afore your selfe, and not suffer me to trust to your counselors; yea
    and that afore I go to the Tower, if it be possible; if not, afore I
    be further condemned. Howbeit, I trust assuredly, your Highnes to wyl
    give me leve to do it afor I go; for that thus shamfully I may not be
    cried out on, as now I shalbe; yea and without cause. Let consciens
    move your Highnes take some bettar way with me, than to make me be
    condemned in al mens sigth, afor my desert knowen. Also I most humbly
    beseche your Highnes to pardon this my boldnes, wiche innocency
    procures me to do, togither with hope of your natural kindnes; wiche I
    trust wyl not se me cast away without desert: wiche what it is, I wold
    desier no more of God, but that you truly knewe. Wiche thinge I thinke
    and beleve you shal never by report knowe, unless by your selfe you

    to the presence of ther Prince: and in late days I harde my Lorde of
    Sommerset say, that if his brother had bine sufferd to speke with him,
    he had never sufferd: but the perswasions wer made to him so gret,
    that he was brogth in belefe that he coulde not live safely if the
    Admiral lived; and that made him give his consent to his dethe. Thogth
    thes parsons ar not to be compared to your majestie, yet I pray God,

      <p>THE BERYL.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the summer of the year 18&mdash;, I was the only passenger on board the
  merchantman, Alceste, which was bound to the Brazils. One fine
  moonlight night, I stood on the deck, and gazed on the quiet ocean, on
  which the moon-beams danced. The wind was so still, that it scarcely
  agitated the sails, which were spread out to invite it. I looked
  round; it was the same on every side&mdash;a world of waters: not a single
  object diversified the view, or intercepted the long and steady glance
  which I threw over the ocean. I have heard many complain of the
  sameness and unvarying uniformity of the objects which oppose
  themselves to the eye of the voyager. I feel differently; I can gaze
  for hours, without weariness, on the deep, occupied with the thought
  it produces; I can listen to the rush of the element as the vessel
  cleaves it, and these things have charms for me which others cannot
  perceive.</p>

  <p>I heard, on a sudden, a noise, which seemed to proceed from the
  captain's cabin, and I thought I could distinguish the voices of
  several men, speaking earnestly, though in a suppressed tone. I
  cautiously drew near the spot from whence the noise arose, but the
  alarm was given, and I could see no one. I retired to rest, or rather
  to lie down; for I felt that heavy and foreboding sense of evil
  overpower me, which comes we know not how or wherefore; and I could
  not sleep, knowing that there had been disputes between the captain
  and his men, respecting some point of discipline, and I feared to
  think what might be the consequences. I lay a long time disturbed with
  these unpleasant reflections; at last, wearied with my thoughts, my
  eyes closed, and I dropped to sleep. But it was not to that refreshing
  sleep which recruits the exhausted spirits, and by awhile "steeping
  the senses in forgetfulness," renders them fitter for exertion on
  awakening. My sleep was haunted with hideous and confused dreams, and
  murder and blood seemed to surround me. I was awakened by convulsive
  starts, and in vain sought again for quiet slumber; the same images
  filled my mind, diversified in a thousand horrid forms. Early in the
  morning, I arose, and went above, and the mild sea breeze dispelled my
  uneasy sensations.</p>

  <p>During the whole of the day nothing seemed to justify the fears that
  had tormented me, and everything went on in its regular course. The
  men pursued their occupations quietly and in silence, and I thought
  the temporary fit of disaffection was passed over. Alas! I remembered
  not that the passions of men, like deep waters, are most to be
  suspected when they seem to glide along most smoothly. Night came on,
  and I retired to rest more composed than on the preceding evening. I
  endeavoured to convince myself that the noises I had heard were but
  the fancies of a disturbed imagination, and I slept soundly. Ill-timed
  security! About midnight I was awakened by a scuffling in the vessel.
  I hastened to the spot; the captain and one of his officers were
  fighting against a multitude of the ship's crew. In a moment after I
  saw the officer fall. Two fellows advanced to me, and, clapping
  pistols to my breast, threatened instant death, if I stirred or spoke.
  I gazed on the bloody spectacle; the bodies, which lay around,
  swimming in gore, testified that the mutineers could not have
  accomplished their aim with impunity. I was horror-struck; a swimming
  sensation came over my eyes, my limbs failed me, and I fell senseless.</p>

  <p>When I recovered, I found myself lying on a bed. Everything was still.
  I listened in vain for a sound; I lay still a considerable time; at
  last, I arose and walked about the ship, but could see no one. I
  searched every part of the vessel; I visited the place of slaughter,
  which I had, at first, carefully avoided; I counted nine dead bodies,
  and the coagulated blood formed a loathsome mass around them; I
  shuddered to think I was desolate&mdash;the companion of death. "Good God!"
  said I, "and they have left me here alone!" The word sounded like a
  knell to me. It now occurred to me, it was necessary the bodies should
  be thrown overboard. I took up one of them, dragged it to the side,
  and plunged it into the waves; but the dash of the heavy body into the
  sea, reminded me more forcibly of my loneliness. The sea was so calm,
  I could scarcely hear it ripple by the vessel's side. One by one I
  committed the bodies to their watery grave. At last my horrible task
  was finished. My next work was to look for the ship's boats, but they
  were gone, as I expected. I could not bear to remain in the ship; it
  seemed a vast tomb for me. I resolved to make some sort of raft, and
  depart in it. This occupied two or three days; at length it was
  completed, and I succeeded in setting it afloat.</p>

  <p>I lowered into it all the provision I could find in the ship, which
  was but <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>
  [pg 213]</span> little, the sailors having, as I imagined, carried off the
  remainder. All was ready, and I prepared to depart. I trembled at the
  thought of the dangers I was about to encounter. I was going to commit
  myself to the ocean, separated from it only by a few boards, which a
  wave might scatter over the surface of the waters. I might never
  arrive at land, or meet with any vessel to rescue me from my danger,
  and I should be exposed, without shelter, and almost without food. I
  half resolved to remain in my present situation; but a moment's
  reflection dispelled the idea of such a measure. I descended; I stood
  on my frail raft; I cut the rope by which it was fastened to the ship.
  I was confused to think of my situation; I could hardly believe that I
  had dared to enter alone on the waste of waters. I endeavoured to
  compose myself, but in vain. As far as I could see, nothing presented
  itself to my view but the vessel I had left; the sea was perfectly
  still, for not the least wind was stirring. I endeavoured, with two
  pieces of board, which supplied the place of oars, to row myself
  along; but the very little progress I made alarmed me. If the calm
  should continue, I should perish of hunger. How I longed to see the
  little sail I had made, agitated by the breeze! I watched it from
  morning to night; it was my only employment; but in vain. The weather
  continued the same. Two days passed over; I looked at my store of
  provisions; it would not, I found, last above three or four days
  longer, at the farthest. They were quickly passing away. I almost gave
  myself up for lost. I had scarcely a hope of escaping.</p>

  <p>On the fourth day since my departure from the ship, I thought I
  perceived something at a distance; I looked at it intently&mdash;it was a
  sail. Good heavens! what were my emotions at the sight! I fastened my
  handkerchief on a piece of wood, and waved it, in hopes that it would
  be observed, and that I should be rescued from my fearful condition.
  The vessel pressed on its course; I shouted;&mdash;I knew they could not
  hear me, but despair impelled me to try so useless an expedient. It
  passed on&mdash;it grew dim&mdash;I stretched my eyeballs to see it&mdash;it
  vanished&mdash;it was gone! I will not attempt to describe the torturing
  feelings which possessed me, at seeing the chance of relief which had
  offered itself destroyed. I was stupified with grief and
  disappointment. My stock of provisions was now entirely exhausted, and
  I looked forward with horror to an excruciating death.</p>

  <p>A little water which had remained, quenched my burning thirst. I
  wished that the waves would rush over me. My hunger soon became
  dreadful, but I had no means of relieving it. I endeavoured to sleep,
  that I might for awhile, forget my torments; and my wearied frame
  yielded for awhile to slumber. When I awoke I was not, however,
  refreshed; I was weak, and felt a burning pain at my stomach. I became
  hourly more feeble; I lay down, but was unable to rise again. My limbs
  lost their strength; my lips and tongue were parched; a convulsive
  shuddering agitated me; my eyes seemed darkened, and I gasped for
  breath.</p>

  <p>The burning at my stomach now departed; I experienced no pain; but a
  dull torpor came over me; my hands and feet became cold; I believed I
  was dying, and I rejoiced at the thought. Presently I lost all thought
  and feeling, and lay, without sense, on a few boards, which divided me
  from the ocean. In this situation, as I was afterwards informed, I was
  taken up by a small vessel, and carried to a seaport town. I slowly
  recovered, and found that I alone, of all who were on board the vessel
  in which I had embarked, had escaped death. The crew, who had departed
  in the boats, after murdering the captain, had met their reward&mdash;the
  boats were shattered against a rock.</p>

  <h3>A STORM IN THE INDIAN SEAS.</h3>


  <p>While the sun was setting with even more than its usual brilliancy,
  and leaving its path marked with streaks of gold, a bird hovered over
  our heads, and suddenly alighted on our taffrail: it was one of
  "Mother Carey's chickens," which by mariners are considered as
  harbingers of ill, and generally of a furious storm. At a warning of
  this kind I did not then feel disposed to take alarm; but there were
  other warnings not to be slighted&mdash;the horizon to the east presented
  the extraordinary appearance of a black cloud in the shape of a bow,
  with its convex towards the sea, and which kept its singular shape and
  position unchanged until nightfall. For the period too of twenty
  minutes after the setting of the sun, the clouds to the north-west
  continued of the colour of blood; but that which most attracted our
  observation was, to us, a remarkable phenomenon&mdash;the sea immediately
  around us, and, as far as the eye could discern by the light of the
  moon, appeared, for about forty minutes, of a perfectly milk white. We
  were visited <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>
  [pg 214]</span> by two more chickens of Mother Carey, both of which
  sought refuge, with our first visiter, on the mainmast. We sounded,
  but found no bottom at a hundred fathoms; a bucket of the water was
  then drawn up, the surface of which was apparently covered with
  innumerable sparks of fire&mdash;an effect said to be caused by the
  animalculae which abound in sea-water: it is at all times common, but
  the sparks are not in general so numerous, nor of such magnitude, as
  were those which then presented themselves. The hand too, being dipped
  in the water, and immediately withdrawn, thousands of them would seem
  to adhere to it. A dismal hollow breeze, which, as the night drew on,
  howled through our rigging, and infused into us all a sombre,
  melancholy feeling, increased by gathering clouds, and the altogether
  portentous state of the atmosphere and elements, ushered in the first
  watch, which was to be kept by Thomson.</p>

  <p>About eight o'clock, loud claps of thunder, each in kind resembling a
  screech, or the blast of a trumpet, rather than the rumbling sound of
  thunder in Europe, burst over our heads, and were succeeded by vivid
  flashes of forked lightning. We now made every necessary preparation
  for a storm, by striking the top-gallant-masts, with their yards,
  close reefing the topsails and foresail, bending the storm-staysail,
  and battening down the main hatch, over which two tarpaulins were
  nailed, for the better preservation of the cargo. We observed
  innumerable shoals of fishes, the motions of which appeared to be more
  than usually vivid and redundant.</p>

  <p>At twelve o'clock, on my taking charge of the deck, the scene bore a
  character widely different from that which it presented but three
  hours before. We now sailed under close-reefed maintopsail and
  foresail. The sea ran high; our bark laboured hard, and pitched
  desperately, and the waves lashed her sides with fury, and were
  evidently increasing in force and size. Over head nothing was to be
  seen but huge travelling clouds, called by sailors the "scud," which
  hurried onwards with the fleetness of the eagle in her flight. Now and
  then the moon, then in her second quarter, would show her disc for an
  instant, but be quickly obscured; or a star of "paly" light peep out,
  and also disappear. The well was sounded, but the vessel did not yet
  make more water than what might be expected in such a sea; we,
  however, kept the pumps going at intervals, in order to prevent the
  cargo from sustaining damage. The wind now increased, and the waves
  rose higher; about two o'clock A.M. the weather maintopsail-sheet gave
  way; the sail then split to ribbons, and before we could clue it up,
  was completely blown away from the bolt-rope. The foresail was then
  furled, not without great difficulty, and imminent hazard to the
  seamen, the storm staysail alone withstanding the mighty wind, which
  seemed to gain strength every half-hour, while the sea, in frightful
  sublimity, towered to an incredible height, frequently making a
  complete breach over our deck.</p>

  <p>At four A.M. I was relieved by Thomson, who at daylight apprized me
  that the maintopmast was sprung, and that the gale was increasing.
  Scarcely had I gone on deck, when a tremendous sea struck us a little
  "abaft the beam," carrying every thing before it, and washing
  overboard hencoops, cables, water-casks, and indeed every movable
  article on the deck. Thomson, almost by miracle, escaped being lost;
  but having, in common with the lascars, taken the precaution to lash a
  rope round his waist, we were able, by its means, to extricate him
  from danger; at the same time the vessel made an appalling lurch,
  lying down on her beam-ends, in which position she remained for the
  space of two minutes, when the maintopmast, followed by the
  foretopmast, went by the board with a dreadful crash; she then
  righted, and we were all immediately engaged in going aloft, and with
  hatchets cutting away the wreck, each of us being lashed with a rope
  round the waist; ropes were also fastened across the deck, in parallel
  lines, to hold on by; for such was the violence of the vessel's
  motion, that without such assistance it would have been impossible to
  stand. As for my Virginia, she was in her cot, hearing all that was
  going forward on deck,&mdash;sensible of her danger, and a prey to the
  apprehension of meeting a death similar to that of her prototype, and
  equally dreadful.</p>

  <p>A drizzling shower now came on, and having continued for some time,
  was at length succeeded by heavy rain, which having been converted
  into sleet, was carried in flakes swiftly along the tops of the
  towering mountains of sea; while the cold sensibly affected the
  already exhausted lascars, at once disinclining them from exertion,
  and incapacitating them from making any; some of them even sat down
  like inanimate statues, with a fixed stare, and a deathlike hue upon
  their countenances: the most afflicting circumstance was, their being
  destitute of warm clothing, which they had neglected to provide
  themselves with, as they ought to have done, out of the four months'
  advance they received in Calcutta. All that I could spare was given to
  Thomson; but unable to endure the sight of their misery, I <span class="pagenum">
  <a id="page215" name="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span> distributed
  among them many articles which I could ill spare,&mdash;sheets, shirts, and
  blankets, except one of the latter, which I had reserved as a
  provision against any further extreme of suffering which might yet
  await us. There was one poor lascar, a simple inoffensive youth, about
  nineteen, who was an object of the liveliest commiseration; he was
  nearly naked, and in that state had been continually drenched by the
  sea and rain, during the whole of the day and night; he was holding
  his hands up to heaven in a supplicating attitude, and shaking in an
  aguish fit; the tears fell in torrents down his cheeks, while he
  uttered his plaints in loud and piercing lamentations. Unable, at
  last, to witness his misery any longer, I rushed down to my
  cabin&mdash;"Can you, Virginia, spare me this blanket without feeling the
  cold too much yourself?&mdash;it is to save the life of a
  fellow-creature."&mdash;"Yes, take it; but stay with me, or, under the
  horrors I feel, I shall die in this cabin, and alone. I know we must
  perish, and why not die together?" I entreated her to support herself
  with all the fortitude she could collect, urged the impossibility of
  my keeping her company, as every moment called for my assistance; and
  assuring her there was no real danger, I hurried on deck with the
  blanket, and wrapped the poor wretch in its folds. I thought he would
  have worshipped me.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>It was about four o'clock, on the fifth morning, that I ventured into
  my cabin, to repose myself on my cot until daylight, more with the
  persuasion that my presence would inspire Virginia with fresh hopes,
  and, in consequence, better spirits, than that the storm had in the
  least abated, or that the peril had become less imminent. At six,
  Thomson, whom I had left in charge of the deck, aroused me by bawling,
  in a voice necessarily raised to the highest pitch, to make itself
  heard amidst the howling, or rather screaming of the
  elements&mdash;"Naufragus!" I instantly jumped up, without waiting any
  specific communication, and, on reaching the deck, found the pumps at
  work, and was informed that we had five feet water in the hold, and
  that the water was gaining upon us fast, notwithstanding the pumps had
  been kept constantly going.&mdash;"Well," said Thomson, in a low tone, not
  to be heard by the crew, "we'll do our best, as long as she floats,
  but that cannot now be much longer&mdash;it's all over with us, depend upon
  it!" There was no time for argument; the pumps were now the chief
  object of our attention; and Thomson and myself, with the secunnies,
  plied them incessantly, until we were ready to drop down with fatigue.</p>

  <p>In a short time we found that the water brought up by the pumps bore a
  brownish colour, and, on tasting it, that it was sweet; so that it was
  evident we were pumping up the sugar, which being contained in
  baskets, was but ill protected against water. Such is the fondness for
  life, that on the appearance of any sudden or immediate cause of
  dissolution, any consideration unconnected with the paramount one of
  preservation, is set at naught; thus, although I was sensible that my
  valuable cargo was momentarily diminishing, and my property wasting
  away, I then felt no disposition to regret my loss, the powers of my
  mind, and the affections of my heart, being all engaged on higher
  objects.</p>

  <p>Those lascars who could at all be brought to the pumps were in so
  wretched and debilitated a state, as to require constant reliefs. For
  one day and two nights, except a few short intervals, Thomson and
  myself, with the secunnies, were at the pumps: at the end of that
  time, our hands were blistered to such a degree, that the skin having
  peeled off, the raw flesh appeared; our arms, thighs, and legs were so
  dreadfully swelled, and our loins in such tormenting pain, as to make
  it impossible for us to continue the exertion, without suffering
  extreme agony; and nothing but the melancholy conviction that we must
  continue our labour, or perish, could possibly have sustained us under
  such hardships&mdash;hardships, however, which we had the heartfelt
  satisfaction to find were so far from being useless, that on perusing
  the sounding-rod, when pulled up from the well, (which we did under
  feelings of extreme anxiety and eagerness,) we were convinced that the
  water did not gain upon us. Our spirits, however, received no
  encouragement from the appearance of the elements; the clouds were
  black and frowning, and all around still bore a threatening
  appearance, the hurricane indeed having rather increased than in the
  slightest degree abated.</p>

  <p>The circumstance of our having on board so perishable and light a
  cargo as soft sugar, it is remarkable, was the very means of our
  preservation. Had it consisted of almost any other article, either of
  pepper or of dead wood, we must inevitably have perished. To have
  thrown overboard any heavy cargo, would, from the constant and heavy
  breaches which the sea made over us, have been impossible. Neither
  could the masts have been cut away, for the purpose of lightening the
  vessel, in consequence of the imbecile condition of the crew; a
  recourse to so <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>
  [pg 216]</span> hazardous a measure would, under our circumstances,
  most likely have proved the cause of our destruction. As it was, from
  constant pumping for three days, we found our vessel as light and
  buoyant as a cork, and, with the exception of the baskets in which the
  sugar had been stowed, as empty as when I first purchased her.</p>

  <p>Night approached, bringing with it additional horrors. The secunnies,
  who had hitherto borne their hardships with admirable fortitude, now
  began to droop, and to express a violent inclination for more rum,
  although as much had been given them as they could possibly bear;
  indeed, rum, with dough, half-baked, had formed their only sustenance
  during the whole period of our sufferings. As for the pumps, we were
  now so lightened, they did not require to be worked at all; but the
  greatest dread we laboured under was from the dangerous condition of
  the main and fore masts, that tottered to and fro, threatening to go
  by the board every minute. Before the hour of sunset, a large bird,
  called the albatross, with wings the length of four to five feet each,
  skimmed along the surface of the waves, close to and around us; this
  inspired the crew with hopes, as they supposed it to be a good omen.
  It remained hovering near our unfortunate wreck for some minutes,
  until it alighted on the waves, where it was seen riding perfectly at
  ease, and with the majesty of a fine large swan, now on the summit of
  a tremendous mountain of waters, and now in the ravines of a wide and
  deep abyss. At length darkness once more encompassed us around, and
  seemed to shut us out from even a ray of hope; the desponding few,
  whose senses were still left them, apparently felt with more acuteness
  than before, the desperation and horrors of their condition. At the
  hour of eight P.M., however, the wind suddenly changed from south-east
  to south-west, and soon appeared to be dying away. At this happy
  circumstance, whereby a prospect of deliverance from the very depths
  of despair was opened to us, the feelings manifested by the crew were
  as singular as they were various; some shouted for joy&mdash;some
  cried&mdash;others muttered prayers&mdash;while a few were still despondent,
  presenting wild and savage-looking features, and seeming to regret
  that the billows had not swallowed them up.&mdash;<i>Adventures of
  Naufragus</i>.</p>

  <h3>DAMP BEDS.</h3>


  <p>Clean sheets are not remarkably common at common inns, where, I am
  informed, that the practice is to take them from the bed, sprinkle
  them with water, to fold them down, and then put them in a press. When
  they are wanted again, they are, literally speaking, shewn to the
  fire, and in a reeking state laid on the bed. The traveller is tired
  and sleepy, dreams of that pleasure or that business which brought him
  from home, and the remotest thing from his mind is, that from the very
  repose which he fancies has refreshed him, he has received the
  rheumatism. The receipt, therefore, to sleep comfortably at inns, is
  to take your own sheets, to have plenty of flannel gowns, and to
  promise, and take care to pay, a handsome consideration for the
  liberty of choosing your beds. Damp beds are oftenest found in inns
  that are least visited; they ought to be carefully avoided, for they
  not only produce dreadful disorders, but have often proved the death
  of the person who has had the misfortune to sleep in them. Especially
  in winter, not only examine the beds, to see whether they are quite
  dry, but have the bedclothes in your presence put before the fire.
  Just before you go to bed, order a pan of hot coals to be run through
  it, then place a clean tumbler inverted between the sheets, and let it
  remain there for a few minutes;&mdash;if on withdrawing it the slightest
  cloud is observable on the inner surface, be certain that either the
  bed or the sheets are damp: sleeping in the blankets is a
  disagreeable, but the safest way of escaping such danger: there are
  many persons in the habit of travelling, who make it a constant
  practice. A wash leather sheet, about 8 feet by 5, is not an
  unpleasant substitute for linen. But the only absolutely safe plan is,
  to sleep in a bed which you are sure has been occupied the night
  before; and that, must be the best-aired bed which was slept in by the
  best-aired person!&mdash;Qy. The cook?&mdash;<i>The Traveller's Oracle</i>.</p>

  <h3>BURMAN THIEVES.</h3>


  <p>The Burmans used to approach, on dark nights, on their hands and
  knees, and often crawled close up to the sentinels, before they were
  discovered; sometimes they carried off knapsacks and arms, and went
  away with their booty unperceived.</p>

  <p>A laughable instance of their dexterity took place in the Great
  Pagoda, on the night of the 2nd July. The soldiers, for several nights
  previous, had missed some arms, although a sentry was before the door,
  and they generally slept with their firelocks by their sides. This
  evening, every one was on the alert, extra sentries were posted, and
  every precaution taken <span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217">
  </a>[pg 217]</span> to secure the marauders. When, on a sudden, the
  alarm being given, the officer on duty, who was reposing in one of the
  little temples, ran to the door and inquired what had occurred,&mdash;but
  hearing that only a knapsack had been found in the grass, and that no
  other traces existed of the depredators, he turned round to lie down
  again, and, to his infinite astonishment, found his bed had vanished!
  A light was in the room, and a servant sleeping near it, yet,
  notwithstanding, the impudent thieves had also ransacked a basket, and
  escaped with the contents! We since heard that the robbers were Burman
  soldiers belonging to the camp at Kumaroot, whither they carried their
  spoils. They certainly deserved infinite credit for the ingenuity they
  manifested, and for the manner in which they turned the laugh against
  us, by showing, that the very moment they chose for their
  depredations, was one when a strict search was making after them.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The people of Kanem, in Central Africa, are known by the name of
  Kanemboo, and consist of tribes of Tibboos. The women are
  good-looking, laughing negresses, and all but naked. Most of them have
  a square or triangular piece of silver or tin hanging at the back of
  the head, suspended from the hair, which is curiously and laboriously
  trained, and no one of tender years has anything like a perfect head
  of hair. From childhood the head is shaved, having only the top
  covered; the hair from hence falls down quite round from the forehead
  to the pole of the neck, and is then formed into one solid plait,
  which in front lying quite flat just over the eyes, and behind being
  turned up with a little curl, has just the appearance of an
  old-fashioned coachman's wig in London.</p>

  <p>The women flock from the neighbouring negro villages to the weekly
  fsug, or market, with baskets of gussut, gafooly, fowls, and honey,
  which may be purchased by small pieces of coral amber of the coarsest
  kind, and coloured beads. Major Denham, in his "Travels in Northern
  and Central Africa," says "one merchant bought a fine lamb for two
  bits of amber, worth, I should think, about two-pence each in Europe;
  two needles purchased a fowl; and a handful of salt, four or five
  good-sized fish from the lake (Tchad)."</p>

  </div>


  <p>The Shouaa Arabs are a very extraordinary race, and have scarcely any
  resemblance to the Arabs of the north; they have fine open
  countenances, with aquiline noses, and large eyes; their complexion is
  a light copper-colour; they possess great cunning with their courage,
  and resemble in appearance some of our best favoured gipsies in
  England, particularly the <i>women</i>; and their Arabic is nearly pure
  Egyptian.</p>

  <p>The best residences of the Shouaas consist of two enclosures, besides
  one for their horses, cows, and goats. In the first of these divisions
  is a circular hut, with a cupola top, well thatched with gussub straw,
  something resembling that of the Indian corn; the walls are of the
  same materials; a mud wall, of about two feet high, separates one part
  from the rest, and here their corn is kept; and a bench of like
  composition, at the opposite side, is their resting-place; this is
  covered with mats; and spears and wooden bowls for water and milk,
  hang on pegs, and complete the furniture; here is the master's own
  apartment. In the second <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218">
  </a>[pg 218]</span> division are two huts, rather smaller, about
  ten paces from each other, in which dwell his wives.</p>


  <h4>AFRICAN FUNERALS.</h4>


  <p>The custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses, is
  prevalent on the Gold Coast of Africa, as far as that country is known
  to Europeans. The ceremony is purely Pagan, and without any form,
  except that of the females of the family of the deceased and their
  friends making a mournful lamentation; and in some instances they work
  their feelings up to such a degree of apparent sorrow, that their
  conduct has every symptom of insanity. This scene of revelry is not a
  little heightened by the profuse use of ardent spirits, which has so
  powerful an attraction, that drummers, flute-players, bards, and
  singing men come from great distances to partake of the libations; and
  as the savage uproar lasts often for a week, it leads to every kind of
  dissolute practice in both sexes. Another custom, or repetition of
  this barbarous usage, frequently takes place seven years after the
  demise of persons of consequence, which is still more expensive than
  the former: as such are the baneful prejudices in favour of these
  habits, that families have too frequently pawned their relatives to
  raise money to defray the expense; they purchase cattle, sheep, goats,
  and poultry, and with the assistance of what is brought by their
  friends and acquaintances, they are enabled to keep up a scene of riot
  for many days. The carcasses of animals sacrificed are not burned and
  sown in the wind as in times of old, but the Fantees more wisely, eat
  them, greater attention being paid to the flavour of the viands and
  the fragrance of the strong liquor than to the manes of the dead.</p>

  <h3>WILLY M'GEE'S MONKEY.</h3>


  <p>I dinna think that in a' nature there's a mair curiouser cratur than
  a monkey. I mak this observe frae being witness to an extraordinar'
  event that took place in Hamilton. Folk may talk as they like about
  monkeys, and cry them down for being stupid and mischievous, I for ane
  will no gang that length. Whatever they may be on the score of
  mischief, there can be nae doubt, that, sae far as gumption is
  concerned, they are just uncommon; and for wit and fun they would beat
  ony man black and blue. In fact, I dinna think that monkeys are beasts
  ava. I hae a half notion that they are just wee hairy men that canna,
  or rather that winna speak, in case they be made to work like ither
  folk, instead of leading a life of idleness.</p>

  <p>But to the point: I ance had a monkey, ane of the drollest-looking
  deevils ye ever saw. He was gayan big for a monkey, and was hairy
  a' ower, except his face and his bit hurdies, which had a degree of
  bareness about them, and were nearly as saft as a lady's loof. Weel,
  what think ye that I did wi' the beastie? Odds, man, I dressed him up
  like a Heelandman, and put a kilt upon him, and a lang-tailed red
  coat, and a blue bannet, which for security's sake I tied, woman-like,
  below his chin wi' twa bits of yellow ribbon. I not only did this, but
  I learnt him to walk upon his twa hinder legs, and to carry a stick
  in his right hand when he gaed out, the better to support him in his
  peregrinations. He was for a' the world like a wee man in kilts.</p>

  <p>Weel, it turned out in this manner, as ye shall hear. Ae afternoon
  towards the glomin' I was oblegated to tak' a stap doun to the cross,
  wi' a web under my arm, which I had finished for Mr. Weft, the muslin
  manufacturer. By way of frolic, a gayan foolish ane I allow, I brocht
  Nosey (the monkey's name,) alang wi' me. He had on, as for ordinar',
  his Heeland dress, and walkit behint me, wi' the bit stick in his
  hand, and his tail sticking out frae below his kilt, as if he had been
  my flunky. It was, after a', a queer sicht, and, as may be supposed, I
  drew a haill crowd of bairns after me, bawling out, "Here's Willy
  M'Gee's monkey," and gi'eing him nits and gingerbread, and makin' as
  muckle of the cratur as could be; for Nosey was a great favourite in
  the town, and everbody likit him for his droll tricks, and the way he
  used to girn, and dance, and tumble ower his head, to amuse them.</p>

  <p>On entering Mr. Weft's shop, I faund it empty; there wasna a leeving
  soul within. I supposed he had gane out for a licht; and being gayan
  familiar wi' him, I took a stap ben to the back shop, leaving Nosey in
  the fore ane. I sat for twa or three minutes, but naebody made his
  appearance. At last the front door, which I had ta'en care to shut
  after me, opened, and I look't to see wha it could be, thinking that,
  nae doubt, it was Mr. Weft, or his apprentice. It was neither the ane
  nor the ither, but a strong middle-aged, red-faced Heelandman, wi'
  specks on, and wi' a kilt and a bannet, by a' the <span class="pagenum">
  <a id="page219" name="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span> world like my
  monkey's. Now, what think ye Nosey was about a' this time? He was
  sittin' behind the counter upon the lang three-leggit stool that stood
  fornent Mr. Weft's desk, and was turning ower the leaves of his
  ledger, wi' a look which, for auld-fashioned sagaciousness, was
  wonderfu' to behold. I was sae tickled at the sight that I paid nae
  sort of attention to the Heelandman, but continued looking frae the
  back shop at Nosey, lauching a' the time in my sleeve&mdash;for I jealoused
  that some queer scene would tak' place between the twa. And I wasna
  far wrang, for the stranger, takin' out a pound frae his spleuchan,
  handed it ower to the monkey, and speered at him, in his droll norlan
  deealect, if he could change a note. When I heard this I thocht I
  would hae lauched outricht; and naething but sheer curiosity to see
  how the thing would end made me keep my gravity. It was plain that
  Donald had ta'en Nosey for ane of his ain countrymen&mdash;and the thing
  after a' wasna greatly to be wondered at, and that for three
  reasons:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Firstly, the shop was rather darkish.</p>

  <p>Secondly, the Heelandman had on specks, as I hae just said; and it was
  likely on this account that he was rather short-sighted; and</p>

  <p>Thirdly, Nosey, wi' his kilt, and bannet, and red coat, was, to a'
  intents and purposes, as like a human creatur as a monkey could weel
  be.</p>

  <p>Nae sooner, then, had he got the note, than he opened it out, and
  lookit at it wi' his wee glowrin', restless een, as if to see that it
  wasna a forgery. He then shook his head like a doctor, when he's no
  very sure what's wrang wi' a person, but wants to mak' it appear that
  he kens a' about it&mdash;and continued in this style till the Heelandman's
  patience began to get exhausted.</p>

  <p>"Can ye no change the note, old shentleman?" quo' Donald. Nosey gi'ed
  his head anither shake, and looked uncommon wise.</p>

  <p>"Is the note no goot, sir?"' spak the Heelandman, a second time; but
  the cratur, instead of answering him, only gi'ed anither of his wise
  shakes, as much as to say, "I'm no very sure about it." At this Donald
  lost temper. "If the note doesna please ye, sir," quo' he, "I'll thank
  ye to gie me it back again, and I'll gang to some ither place." And he
  stretchit out his hand to tak hand o't, when my frien' wi' the tail,
  lifting up his stick, lent him sic a whack ower the fingers as made
  him pu' back in the twinkling of an ee.</p>

  <p>"Got tamn ye, ye auld scounrel," said the man; "do ye mean to tak my
  money frae me?" And he lifted up a rung big eneuch to fell a stot, and
  let flee at the monkey; but Nosey was ower quick for him, and jumping
  aside, he lichted on a shelf before ane could say Jock Robinson. Here
  he rowed up the note like a baw in his hand, and put it into his coat
  pouch like any rational cratur. Not only this, but he mockit the
  Heelandman by a' manner of means, shooting out his tongue at him,
  spitting at him, and girning at him wi' his queer outlandish
  physiognomy. Then he would tak haud of his tail in his twa hands, and
  wag it at Donald, and steeking his nieves, he would seem to threaten
  him wi' a leatherin'. A'thegither he was desperate impudent, and
  eneuch to try the patience of a saunt, no to spak o' a het-bluided
  Heelandman. It was gude for sair een to see how Donald behavit on this
  occasion. He raged like ane demented, misca'ing the monkey beyond
  measure, and swearing as mony Gaelic aiths as micht hae sair'd an
  ordinar man for a twalmonth. During this time, I never sterr'd a foot,
  but keepit keeking frae the back shop upon a' that was ganging on. I
  was highly delighted; and jealousing that Nosey was ower supple to be
  easily catched, I had nae apprehension for the event, and remained
  snug in my birth to see the upshot.</p>

  <p>In a short time, in comes Mr. Weft wi' a piece of lowing paper in his
  hand that he had got frae the next door to licht the shop; and nae
  sooner did Donald see him than he ax'd him for his note.</p>

  <p>"What note, honest man?" said Mr. Weft.</p>

  <p>"Got tamn," quo' Donald; "the note the auld scounrel, your
  grandfather, stole frae me."</p>

  <p>"My grandfaither!" answered the ither wi' amazement. "I am thinking,
  honest man, ye hae had a glass ower muckle. My grandfaither has been
  dead for saxteen years, and I ne'er heard tell till now that he was a
  fief."</p>

  <p>"Weel, weel, then," quo' the Heelandman, "I don't care naething about
  it. If he's no your grandfaither, he'll be your faither, or your
  brither, or your cousin."</p>

  <p>"My faither or my brither, or my cousin!" repeated Mr. Weft. "I maun
  tell ye plainly, frien', that I hae neither faither, nor brither, nor
  cousin of ony description on this side of the grave. I dinna
  understand ye, honest man, but I reckon that ye hae sat ower lang at
  the whisky, and my advice to ye is to stap awa hame and sleep it aff."</p>

  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>
  <p>At this speech the Heelandman lost a' patience, and lookit sae awfully
  fairce, that ance or twice I was on the nick of coming forrit, and
  explaining how matters really stood; but curiosity keepit me chained
  to the back shop, and I just thocht I would bide a wee, and see how
  the affair was like to end.</p>

  <p>"Pray, wha are you, sir?" said Donald, putting his hands in his sides,
  and looking through his specks upon Mr. Weft, like a deevil incarnit.
  "Wha are you, sir, that daar to speak to me in this manner?"</p>

  <p>"Wha am I?" said the ither, drapping the remnant of the paper, which
  was burnin' close to his fingers. "I am Saunders Weft, manufacturir In
  Hamilton&mdash;that's what I am."</p>

  <p>"And I am Tonald Campbell, piper's sister's son to his grace the
  great, grand Tuke of Argyle," thundered out the Heelandman, wi' a
  voice that was fearsome to hear.</p>

  <p>"And what about that?" quo' Mr. Weft, rather snappishly, as I thocht.
  "If ye were the great, grand Duke of Argyle himself, as ye ca' him,
  I'll no permit you to kick up a dust in my shop."</p>

  <p>"Ye scounrel," said Donald, seizing Mr. Weft by the throat, and
  shaking him till he tottered like an aspen leaf, "div ye mean to speak
  ill of his grace the Tuke of Argyle?" And he gi'ed him anither
  shake&mdash;then, laying haud of his nose, he swore that he would pu't as
  lang as a cow's tail, if he didna that instant restore him his lost
  property. At this sicht I began to grew a' ower, and now saw the
  needcessity of stapping ben, and saving my employer frae farther
  damage, bodily and itherwise. Nae sooner had I made my appearance than
  Donald let go his grip of Mr. Weft's nose, and the latter, in a great
  passion, cried out, "William M'Gee, I tak ye to witness what I hae
  sufferit frae this bluid-thirsty Heelandman! It's no to be endured in
  a Christian country. I'll hae the law of him, that I will. I'll be
  whuppit but I'll hae amends, although it costs me twenty pounds!"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" quo' I, pretending ignorance of the haill
  concern. "What, in the name of Nebuchadnezzar, has set ye thegither by
  the lugs?" Then Mr. Weft began his tale, how he had been collared and
  weel nigh thrappled in his ain shop;&mdash;then the ither tauld how, in the
  first place, Mr. Weft's grandfather, as he ca'd Nosey, had stolen his
  note, and how, in the second place, Mr. Weft himsell had insulted the
  great, grand Duke of Argyle. In a word, there was a desperate kick-up
  between them, the ane threeping that he would tak the law of the ither
  immediately. Na, in this respect Donald gaed the greatest lengths, for
  he swore that, rather than be defeat, he wad carry his cause to the
  house of lords, although it cost him thretty pounds sterling. I now
  saw it was time to put in a word.</p>

  <p>"Houts-touts, gentlemen," quo' I, "what's the use of a' this
  clishmaclaver? Ye've baith gotten the wrang sow by the lug, or my
  name's no William M'Gee. I'll wager ye a pennypiece, that my monkey,
  Nosey is at the bottom of the business."</p>

  <p>Nae sooner had I spoken the word, than the twa, looking round the
  shop, spied the beastie sitting upon the shelf girning at them, and
  putting out his tongue, and wiggle-waggling his walking-stick ower his
  left elbow, as if he had been playing upon the fiddle. Mr. Weft at
  this apparition set up a loud lauch; his passion left him in a moment,
  when he saw the ridiculous mistake that the Heelandman had fa'en into,
  and I thocht he would hae bursted his sides wi' evendown merriment. At
  first Donald lookit desperate angry, and judging frae the way he was
  twisting about his mouth and rowing his een, I opined that he intended
  some deadly skaith to the monkey. But his gude sense, of which
  Heelandmen are no a'thegither destitute, got the better of his anger,
  and he roared and lauched like the very mischief. Nor was this a', for
  nae sooner had he began to lauch, than the monkey did the same thing,
  and held its sides in precisely the same manner, imitating his
  actions, in the maist amusin' way imaginable. This only set Donald a
  lauching mair than ever, and when he lifted up his nieve, and shook it
  at Nosey in a gude humoured way, what think ye that the cratur did?
  Odds man, he took the note frae his pouch, whare it lay rowed up like
  a baw, and, papping it at Donald, hit him as fairly upon the nose, as
  if it had been shot out of a weel-aimed musket. There was nae
  resisting this. The haill three, or rather the haill four, for Nosey
  joined us, set up a loud lauch; and the Heelandman's was the loudest
  of a', showing that he was really a man of sense, and could tak a joke
  as weel as his neighbours.</p>

  <p>When the lauchin' had a wee subsided, Mr. Campbell, in order to show
  that he had nae ill wull to Mr. Weft, ax'd his pardon for the rough
  way he had treated him, but the worthy manufacturer wadna hear o't.
  "Houts, man," quo' he, "dinna say a word about it. It's a mistak
  a'thegether, and Solomon himsell, ye ken, <span class="pagenum">
  <a id="page221" name="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span> whiles gaed wrang."
  Whereupon the Heelandman bought a Kilmarnock nichtcap, price
  elevenpence happeny, frae Mr. Weft, and paid him wi' part of the very
  note that brocht on the ferly I hae just been relating. But his gude
  wull didna end here, for he insisted on takin' us a'&mdash;Nosey amang the
  lave&mdash;to the nearest public, where he gi'ed us a frien'ly glass, and
  we keepit tawking about monkeys, and what not, in a manner at ance
  edifying and amusing to hear.&mdash;<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>.</p>

  <blockquote>
     <p>"To marry!&mdash;Why, every man plays the fool once in his
      life&mdash;but to marry is playing the fool all one's life
      long."&mdash;CONGREVE.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is something so satisfactory in knowing at once the limit of
  your fortunes&mdash;in making yourself secure in the first instance of that
  happiness to which all your exertions are directed,&mdash;which is in fact
  the end and aim of your worldly existence, and of all your worldly
  toils&mdash;the enjoyment of domestic peace and love;&mdash;in quenching that
  restless, burning anxiety, which is ever busy within the bosom of the
  young and the aspiring. Marrying early, in fact, is taking time by the
  forelock, and leading your future destinies after you, instead of
  suffering yourself to be led and tossed about by them,&mdash;it is tearing
  away the black veil from the brow of futurity, and perusing all her
  lineaments in her own despite. It is [he continued with an oratorical
  attitude] building your fate upon a rock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" I exclaimed, "stop there&mdash;that <i>rock</i> is so commonplace."</p>

  <p>Harry laughed and went on with his argument.&mdash;"Besides, there is the
  gratification of making yourself <i>considered</i> in society&mdash;which no
  single man is. A single man is a kind of protected or licensed
  vagabond&mdash;rambling to and fro without stamp or mark, as Witwould might
  say,&mdash;like a sheep that has been overlooked at tarring time. His home
  is a desert to him,&mdash;and the love of social converse, which is so
  natural, and so amiable at the same time keeps him eternally in a
  state of fidgetty restlessness, which precludes all possibility of
  serious and persevering labour. Only think of the horrors of a house
  without a queen&mdash;Yawning servants, negligent housekeepers, extorting
  tradespeople,&mdash;these and a thousand other annoyances, for which you
  have no relief, because you cannot stoop to meddle or make in such
  transactions&mdash;are the agitations which perpetually infest the domestic
  commonwealth of a bachelor.&mdash;But turn your eyes into the house of
  'Benedick, the married man'&mdash;He wears his rue with a difference,
  indeed!&mdash;There is a sense of life, bustle, mirth, and happiness, in
  the very air of the dwelling. To be greeted with smiles at your going
  forth and coming in&mdash;to know that there is at least one who serves you
  without a self-interest&mdash;to hear the joyous, feminine laugh, delicate
  and temperate in the very whirlwind of its ecstacy, ring through the
  mansion from hour to hour&mdash;to hear the little foot pattering about you
  as you sit at your philosophic studies&mdash;to have a friend with whom you
  can converse freely and without fear of present offence or future
  disadvantage&mdash;and whose presence is not without its influence and its
  charm, even when the call of a worldly ambition summons you to&mdash;</p>

      <p>Your tasks, in social silence too,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>with just sense enough to understand all you can say to her&mdash;and
  nothing so wise as to mortify you at any time by setting you right.
  Then, instead of the natty primness of your bachelor's apartment, you
  have your eyes feasted by that elegant confusion of the little
  sanctuary&mdash;the charm of which cannot, unseen, be apprehended, and is
  only known to those who are privileged to enter, by the passport of
  Hymen. A bit of bobbin here&mdash;a thread-paper there&mdash;here a hat
  feather&mdash;there a scrap of silk.&mdash;Besides," [drawing his chair closer
  to mine and looking <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222">
  </a>[pg 222]</span> very tender] "when you love her, you know&mdash;." He
  paused and sighed, and I groaned strenuously.&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And is this all you have to say in defence of an elopement with a
  girl of sixteen." ["A beautiful girl," he passionately interrupted]
  "well! a beautiful girl&mdash;so young, that it is perfectly impossible for
  you to form any judgment on her inclinations or her temper&mdash;at a time
  when her character is undecided&mdash;unformed&mdash;when that which is mere
  caprice, frequently assumes the hue of passion, and wears all its
  fervour and intensity. Or if it should continue unabated&mdash;as I must
  confess [observing him turn himself with an air before a pier glass,]
  I see no reason why it should not&mdash;you will find the unsophistication
  of the young lady as quickly tending to domestic disquiet, as might
  have been her inconstancy&mdash;She will be unreasonable in her exactions
  on your confidence, and you will be compelled to take refuge in fits
  of sullenness&mdash;perhaps rudeness;&mdash;and then what becomes of that
  blissful state, where like you, every body expects, and so very&mdash;very
  few <i>find</i> happiness?&mdash;to secure which the most perfect union of taste
  and feeling&mdash;the utmost kindliness of manner, and a politeness as
  habitual as motion itself, are absolute requisites?&mdash;Have you no
  further arguments to offer in favour of this measure of yours?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said he, very dryly, "I have one more."</p>

  <p>"What may that be?"</p>

  <p>"That I WILL marry her."</p>

  <p>"Oh!..." said I.</p>

  <p>And without exchanging another word, I put on my great coat, and we
  sallied forth together to the rendezvous of the lovers. The fair
  fugitive was true to her appointment, and at the first sound of the
  expected footfall, glided from her concealment into the happy
  scoundrel's arms. The action which followed I could not see (though it
  was a bright moonlight,) for a breeze lifted the large veil which hung
  over the lady's shoulder, in such a manner as to envelope the
  countenances of both. What the action <i>ought</i> to have been, perhaps
  you, madam, or you, mademoiselle, may inform me?&mdash;I only know that
  when the modest zephyr passed, and the veil fell back again, the fair
  cheek that it revealed glowed with</p>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't,</p>
      <p>Might well have warm'd old Saturn."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Harry gave me his hand (heartily) as he stood on the carriage step,
  and the bride wafted me a farewell with the prettiest action of her
  fan from the window, and murmured,&mdash;"Give me a good wish for the
  tobacconist."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I; "may you never have occasion to say of the love that
  now leads you to him, that</p>
  <blockquote>
      <p>"'Its beacon light is quench'd in <i>smoke</i>.'"</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>[For although naturally grave, and silently given, I often catch
  myself endeavouring to sport a bad pun, when I have got the ear of a
  fair damsel] The only effect which the witticism produced in the
  present instance, however, was an enormous groan, in which the fellows
  on the dickey participated. Even the postilion who stood near, set up
  a crowing laugh&mdash;and the very horses by their snorting and neighing,
  seemed to be sensible of the utter and deplorable failure.</p>

  <p>And away they went&mdash;and they were hotly pursued, and overtaken, <i>just</i>
  in time to be too late&mdash;which left no other course but that of
  reconciliation;&mdash;and where there is no choice to be made, every body
  knows there is but one part to be taken.</p>

  <p>That occurrence is now three years since, and it was only the other
  day that I again met the pair of turtles. Dropping in rather late at a
  card-party, I beheld them sitting vis-a-vis at one of the tables,
  playing together against an old lady and gentleman, before whom Mrs.
  L&mdash;&mdash; thought, perhaps, it was not necessary to appear <i>very</i>
  fashionable towards dear Harry. With the requisite <i>ceremonious
  unceremoniousness</i> so popular at present, I took a chair behind him,
  and annoyed him every moment by remarks upon his wife; of course all
  highly nattering to both.</p>

  <p>"My love, you have played that card wrong&mdash;very wrong."</p>

  <p>"Did I, my dear?" replied Mrs. L. smiling languidly, and looking in
  his face more as if she was admiring the elegant turn of his forehead,
  and the spirited expression of his dark eye, than as if she minded
  what he was saying&mdash;"'tis indeed&mdash;very."</p>

  <p>"'Tis what?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! were you not speaking of something? I beg pardon, love&mdash;I thought
  you spoke."</p>

  <p>"And so I did, my dear. I told you that card was played most
  abominably."</p>

  <p>"I dare say, my love;&mdash;[still gazing in his eyes and smiling]&mdash;I know
  I'm very stupid,"&mdash;[playing a card.]</p>

  <p>"Well, you have taken a curious way to mend matters&mdash;that last play
  was a thousand degrees worse than the other."</p>

  <p>"I dare say, my love,&mdash;[looking in his face, and continuing to drawl
  and simper in the manner which we might <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223"

  <p>"But tell me, love, when I play wrong," [playing again without taking
  her eyes from his, even to look at her card.]</p>

  <p>"I had much better leave you to yourself," said L.</p>

  <p>"'<i>You will be compelled to take refuge in fits of sullenness</i>,'"
  muttered I, quoting from my former prophecy.</p>

  <p>"My dear,"&mdash;[pronounced just in the same way as he might have said,
  'you fool,']&mdash;pray open your eyes."</p>

  <p>"<i>Perhaps in rudeness</i>," I continued.</p>

  <p>"There again!" cried poor L&mdash;&mdash;, who seemed in danger of being ruined
  by the admiration of his wife. "It is not possible for a card to be
  played worse than that. Your head, my dear, must be as confused as
  your boudoir."</p>

  <p>"<i>A bit of bobbin here&mdash;a hat feather there</i>," I continued, growing
  malicious.</p>

  <p>"Sir," cried L&mdash;&mdash;, starting round in a passion. Fixing his eyes for a
  moment on my wooden phiz, however, he burst into a fit of laughter,
  and then as suddenly assuming a most doleful change of countenance, he
  squeezed my hand and said to me apart, in a tragic tone, "Ah, my dear

  <h2>USEFUL DOMESTIC HINTS.</h2>

  <hr />

  <h4>FININGS FOR WINES.</h4>


  <p>If wine does not become clear soon enough, for each forty gallons
  dissolve an ounce of isinglass in a quart of water. Strain and mix
  this with part of the liquor, beat it up to a froth, and pour it into
  the rest; stir the whole well, and bung it up, except there should be
  an appearance of fermentation; if so, leave the bung out till it has
  ceased. Instead of isinglass, some use hartshorn shavings, in rather
  larger quantities; red wines are fined with eggs, twelve to the pipe,
  beaten up to a froth, mixed with the wine, <i>and well stirred in</i>.</p>

  <p>Gypsum or alabaster is used to clear cloudy white wines; as also fresh
  slaked lime; and the size of a walnut of sugar of lead, with a table
  spoonful of sal enixum, is put to forty gallons of muddy wine, to
  clear it; and hence, as the sugar of lead is decomposed, and changed
  into an insoluble sulphat of lead, which falls to the bottom, the
  practice is not so dangerous as has been represented.</p>


  <h4>MANNER OF USING FININGS.</h4>


  <p>Put the finings, when ready, into a pail, with a little of what you
  are going to fine; whisk them together till they are perfectly mixed,
  and then nearly fill up the pail with the liquor, whisking it well
  about again, after which, if the cask be full, take out four or five
  gallons to make room; take a staff and stir it well; next whisk the
  finings up, and put them in, stirring well together for five minutes;
  then drive in the bung, leaving the vent-peg loose for three or four
  days, after which drive it in tight.</p>


  <h4>OF FLAVOURING AND COLOURING WINES.</h4>


  <p>The quality of roughness natural to those red wines in which the skins
  and a portion of the stems have been subjected to the process of
  fermentation, is readily communicated by astringent substances, and by
  none more easily or purely than by catechu and kino, substances free
  from injurious flavour; the sloe is also used; similar roughness,
  accompanied with flavour, is given by the chips of oak and beech; and
  if logwood and walnut peels are used, the astringency will also be
  united to a portion of colour and flavour. All these substances may be
  rendered highly useful in giving positive qualities to insipid wines.

  <h3>BIRDS POISONING THEIR YOUNG.</h3>


  <p>Mr. Holmes, in his "Account of the United States of America," relates
  that some of the birds of North America are remarkable for poisoning
  their young; but this is only done if they are encaged or confined.
  The <i>robin</i> is one of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224"
  name="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span> birds thus noticed. If the young be taken,
  and placed in a cage where the parent birds can discover them, they
  will attend upon and feed them for a season; but after the lapse of a
  few days, or when the young are fledged, the old ones appear very
  uneasy, and endeavour to discover some way by which they may escape.
  If, however, they perceive that there is no hope of accomplishing
  their purpose, they procure for them a sort of berry, which is an
  infallible poison; <i>apparently disdaining the thought that their
  offspring should be slaves</i>!</p>

  <h3>A CONNOISSEUR.</h3>


  <p>Vernet relates, that he was once employed to paint a landscape, with a
  cave, and St. Jerome in it; he accordingly painted the landscape, with
  St. Jerome at the entrance of the cave. When he delivered the picture,
  the purchaser, who understood nothing of perspective, said, "the
  landscape and the cave are well made, but St. Jerome is not <i>in</i> the
  cave."&mdash;"I understand you, sir," replied Vernet, "I will alter it." He
  therefore took the painting, and made the shade darker, so that the
  saint seemed to sit farther in. The gentleman took the painting; but
  it again appeared to him that the saint was not in the cave. Vernet
  then wiped out the figure, and gave it to the gentleman, who seemed
  perfectly satisfied. Whenever he saw strangers to whom he showed the
  picture, he said, "Here you see a picture by Vernet, with St. Jerome
  in the cave." "But we cannot see the saint," replied the visiters.
  "Excuse me, gentlemen," answered the possessor, "he is there; for I
  have seen him standing at the entrance, and afterwards farther back;
  and am therefore quite sure that he is in it."</p>

  <h3>BLACK MAN'S DREAM.</h3>


  <p>A number of years bygone, a black man, named Peter Cooper, happened to
  marry a fair lady of Greenock, who did not use him with that
  tenderness that he conceived himself entitled to. Having tried all
  other arts to retrieve her lost affections in vain, Peter at last
  resolved to work upon her fears of punishment in another world for her
  conduct in this. Pretending, therefore, to awake one morning
  extravagantly alarmed, his helpmate was full of anxiety to know what
  was the matter; and having sufficiently, as he thought, whetted her
  curiosity, by mysteriously hinting that "he could a tale unfold," at
  length Peter proceeded as follows:&mdash;"H&mdash;ll of a dream last night. I
  dream I go to Hebben and rap at de doa, and a gent'man came to de doa
  wid black coat and powda hair. Whoa dere? Peeta Coopa.&mdash;Whoa Peeta
  Coopa? Am not know you&mdash;Not knowa Peeta Coopa! Look de book, Sa.&mdash;He
  take de book, and he look de book, and he could'na find Peeta
  Coopa.&mdash;Den I say, Oh! lad, oh! look again, finda Peeta Coopa in a
  corna.&mdash;He take de book, an he look de book, an at last he finda Peeta
  Coopa in lilly, lilly (little) corna.&mdash;'Peeta Coopa, cook ob de <i>Royal
  Charlotte</i> ob Greenock.'&mdash;Walk in, Sa. Den I walk in, and dere was
  every ting&mdash;all kind of vittal&mdash;collyflower too&mdash;an I eat, and I
  drink, and I dance, and I ting, an I neva be done; segar too, by
  Gum.&mdash;Den I say, oh! lad, oh! look for Peeta Coopa wife. He take de

  <h3>MAGICAL CLOCK.</h3>


  <p>Droz, a Genevian mechanic, once constructed a clock which was capable
  of the following surprising movements:&mdash;There were seen on it a negro,
  a dog, and a shepherd; when the clock struck, the shepherd played six
  tunes on his flute, and the dog approached and fawned upon him. This
  clock was exhibited to the King of Spain, who was delighted with it.
  "The gentleness of my dog," said Droz, "is his least merit; if your
  Majesty touch one of the apples, which you see in the shepherd's
  basket, you will admire the fidelity of this animal." The King took an
  apple, and the dog flew at his hand, and barked so loud, that the
  King's dog, which was in the room, began also to bark; at this the
  Courtiers, not doubting that it was an affair of witchcraft, hastily
  left the room, crossing themselves as they went out. The minister of
  Marine was the only one that ventured to stay. The king having desired
  him to ask the negro what o'clock it was, the minister obeyed, but he
  obtained no reply. Droz then observed, that the negro had not yet
  learned Spanish.</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
